In 1776, the Declaration of Independence declared the East Coast free from British control.  Three thousand miles away on the west coast, the Spaniards sought to claim the lands by building twenty-one missions from 1769 to 1823.  California's Missions are a fraction of over one-hundred mission that were built in North America.

When you take a drive along I-101 in California today, the popular coastal highway follows El Camino Real (The King's Road) created as a travel route by Spaniards who built 21 missions.  Each mission was designed to be about a day's journey from the next (approx. 30 miles) and today, you can still visit replicas of the these original missions as you drive on that highway that largely parallels the Pacific Ocean along its route north and south.  Most of the missions are open to the
public with some charging an admission fee while others are free.

Because the contrustion of the missions utilized locally available materials such as adobe brick, there are only a few mission remnants (walls, cornices, towers, etc.) from the original structures that have survived devastating earthquakes and neglect.  The replicas of the original missions, however, provide experiences that allow children and adults to relive the California mission era that began in 1769 and ended not long after the last mission was built in 1823.
